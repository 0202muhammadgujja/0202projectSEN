                <h1>Agriculture & <br>Productivity<br> Enlightment <br></h1>
                <p class="paragraph"><br><br>This website is basically enlighting the public on how important agriculture is to every enviroment. <br>Without agriculture people and animals can't survive, <br>meaning all living things will be extinct, and even if they survive,<br> that survival will surely an expensive which might not last for long,<br> because they have to buy food and more of agricultural products to feed the entire living in that region.<br> Our lord the most beneficial and most merciful knows that for every society to survive they need agriculture, <br>and that is why he blessed us with fertile land and consumable crops that will satisfy our hunger,<br> is hardly you see a place where alot of peaople are living without them farming to feed themselves,<br> their land might not be fartile to grow some crops of over<br> places, but can grow crops of that specific region which is even more sweeter and healthier to them.<br> Now i have well explained the importance of agriculture and how it goes with different peaople from different part of the world,<br> ok now the main reason of developing this site is because peaople are now carried away by the world of technology forgetting the land of food,<br> am not sure whether peaople forgot about the land (agriculture) but am sure people are no longer interested in farming grazing animals and other agricultural activities.<br> Maybe some think we already have enough technology here in this country Nigeria. that will enable us to make products sell and feed the nation. but that is not right,<br> we don't even have enough tech to look over our country talk more of providing for other countries, the little that we have is not even seen reliable to depend on,<br> why? because the government and other organizations rather employ a foreigner, precisely white in skin, that will build and manage their database and other technological appliances they have.<br> So why trying to depend on something we don't have enough, we don't have much knowledge about, we don't have enough money to afford. Rather than focusing on what we have in abundant,<br> that is the fertile land for agriculture and natural resources.<br> some as well think since we have natural resources like crude oil, gold, natural gas, coal, Tin, and others then why going to the farm and stress yourself.<br> This is some peaoples way of thinking. ok my opinion that i would like to share here is,<br> firstly how would we manage and process those natural resources, ans.<br> for us to that effectively we need something doing that will generate income to us, so that we will be able to buy machineries and employ educated peaople that will manage those machineries,<br> and make production easier, faster and qualitative. if we don't have money, how else can we achive that, if not by taking our raw natural resource out of the country for processsing.<br> Mind you they don't process for free anywhere, so with that we have to pay a huge amount of money, And that is nonsense i'll say. So i would highly recommend that we better go back to the land, let the government take path in that,<br> private organizations and every single individual.<br> if we do that we will deffinately see benefits like:- <br><ul>
                    <li> Us being able to feed the nation.</li>
                    <li> Save money because we don't have to buy food again, we already have.</li>
                    <li> employment opportunities </li>
                    <li> sell out our products, and get enough money to improve our educational sectors,<br> refinary sectors, mining sectors, Tech sectors, health sectors and many more  </li>
                </ul>   </p>
